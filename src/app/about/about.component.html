		<h2>About our Mission</h2>
		<p style="page-break-before: always">
		<p>Our mission is to help those struggling with congestive heart failure by enabling them to manage their weight, medications, and doctor's reccomendations
		through the seemless integration of the Fitbit devices and Amazon Alexa.
		</p>

		<p>This project was for our senior capstone design class. To learn more about the program click <a href="https://capstone.cse.sc.edu/about/">here.</a>
		Chris, Mikhail, Tyler, Chase, and Matt all worked on this webapp for Professor Corbett at the University of South Carolina. We are using the 
		<a href="https://dev.fitbit.com/">Fitbit API</a> and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-voice-service/api-overview.html">Amazon Alexa</a>
		to pull data and later with voice integration. If you have any questions about the website, please use the contact page. Our github repo is available
		<a href="https://github.com/SCCapstone/FitbitTeam">here.</a></p>
