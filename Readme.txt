Fitbit Aria Webapp with Alexa Integration

Our project is to create an app that works with the Fitbit Aria scale and Alexa dot in order to help people manage their chronic heart disease. This condition requires careful monitoring, which is why doctors recommend that individuals at risk for heart disease weigh themselves each morning. The app will connect Alexa dot to a daily reminder that individuals should weigh themselves, and if the scale detects a discrepancy in daily or weekly weight, will prompt them to contact their primary care provider.
The FitBit scale and Alexa will work directly with a web application. The scale is connected to a Fitbit account which we can populate the web application via the 'FitBit sdk', i.e. weight and time. The Alexa, can be used to open a skill that connects to the webapp.
